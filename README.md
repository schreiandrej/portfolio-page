# Porfolio Website

My Portfoliowebsite is made with the Next-JS framework.

I'm using tailwind css for styling. I like the utility first approach and since the implementation of the JIT compiler, tailwind is without competion.

For the animation i used for the first time the framer-motion library. It is really easy to handle and the result are amazing.
